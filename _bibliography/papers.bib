    abstract={There is a growing interest in alternative explanations to thedual-system account of how people learn category structuresvarying in their optimal decision bounds (unidimensional andinformation-integration structures).  Recognition memory per-formance and hippocampal activation patterns in these tasksare two interesting findings, which have not been formally ex-plained.   Here,  we  carry  out  a  formal  simulation  with  SUS-TAIN  (Love,  Medin,  &  Gureckis,  2004),  an  adaptive  modelof  category  learning,  which  had  great  success  in  accountingfor recognition memory performance and fMRI activity pat-terns.  We show, for the first time, that a formal single-systemmodel of category learning can accommodate recognition per-formance after learning and is consistent with fMRI data ob-tained while participants learned these structures},

  title={Representing uncertainty in the Rescorla-Wagner model: blocking, the redundancy effect, and outcome base rate},
  author={Spicer, Stuart Gordon and Wills, Andy J. and Jones, Peter M. and Mitchell, Chris and Dome, Lenard},
  keywords={associative learning, prediction error, uncertainty, modelling},
  abstract={It is generally assumed that the Rescorla and Wagner (1972) model adequately accommodates the full results of simple cue competition experiments in humans (e.g. Dickinson et al., 1984), while the Bush and Mosteller (1951) model cannot. We present simulations that demonstrate this assumption is wrong in at least some circumstances. The Rescorla-Wagner model, as usually applied, fits the full results of a simple forward cue-competition experiment no better than the Bush-Mosteller model. Additionally, we present a novel finding, where letting the associative strength of all cues start at an intermediate value (rather than zero), allows this modified model to provide a better account of the experimental data than the (equivalently modified) Bush-Mosteller model. This modification also allows the Rescorla-Wagner model to account for a redundancy effect experiment (Uengoer et al., 2013); something that the unmodified model is not able to do. Furthermore, the modified Rescorla-Wagner model can accommodate the effect of varying the proportion of trials on which the outcome occurs (i.e. the base rate) on the redundancy effect (Jones et al., 2019). Interestingly, the initial associative strength of cues varies in line with the outcome base rate. We propose that this modification provides a simple way of mathematically representing uncertainty about the causal status of novel cues within the confines of the Rescorla-Wagner model. The theoretical implications of this modification are discussed. We also briefly introduce free and open resources to support formal modelling in associative learning.},

  title={Is the Letter Cancellation Task a Suitable Index of Ego Depletion?},
  author={Wimmer, Marina C and Dome, Lenard and Hancock, Peter JB and Wennekers, Thomas},
  ketwords={ego-depletion, inhibitory control, letter cancellation, replication, conceptual questions},
  abstract={The aim was to quantify ego depletion and measure its effect on inhibitory control. Adults (N = 523) received the letter “e” cancellation ego depletion task and were subsequently tested on Stroop task performance. Difficulty of the cancellation task was systematically manipulated by modifying the text from semantically meaningful to non-meaningful sentences and words (Experiment 1) and by increasing ego depletion rule complexity (Experiment 2). Participants’ performance was affected by both text and rule manipulations. There was no relation between ego depletion task performance and subsequent Stroop performance. Thus, irrespective of the difficulty of the ego depletion task, Stroop performance was unaffected. The widely used cancellation task may not be a suitable inducer of ego depletion if ego depletion is considered as a lack of inhibitory control.},
