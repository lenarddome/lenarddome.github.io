I am a Psychology PhD in [Willslab](https://www.andywills.info/) at
[School of Psychology, University of Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools/psychology).

My primary research focuses on **computational modelling of categorization and
human behavioural complexity**. I am also interested in connecting this to work
to impression formation and **social categorization**. My second line of work
looks at **contingency learning, memory and visual search**, mostly from a
formal modelling and theory building point-of-view. 


On the sidelines, I code, read, listen to music, obsess with cinema and analyse every data I
could collect about my life.
