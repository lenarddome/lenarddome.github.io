description: here we go here we fall

I realized that I track a lot of things in my life. I track the films
I watched, the music I listen. I have a multi-sport smart watch, so I track my steps, hikes, workouts,
heart rate, sleep, etc. I also track some of the reasoning behind my life choices,
like being vegetarian (and recurringly vegan depending on money and time), using
a piece of technology, supporting different activist and else.

So here I will analyse these things. Analyses can be through data science,
or philosophy or whatever until it follows some form of logic.

The next post in line is going to be a review of my film viewing behaviour.
I have the urge to justify looking at this activity. I will go into it in the
post, but for now there is a simple reason: films are the main way we acquire
culture and information. Entertainment is a dangerous tool to dissipate information.
